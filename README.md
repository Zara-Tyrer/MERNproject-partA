# MERNproject-partA

Developers: **Jade Tyrer & Cassandra Zara**
Part A of final Coder Academy project - documentation for MERN app

## Outline 

#### Purpose
"Bespoke Nails" is known for creating unique and highly detailed hand-painted designs for nails, is based in the UK, and has an established instagram platform with a strong aesthetic and logo and a loyal customer base. Bespoke Nails (BN) functioned as an in-person apppointment beauty service prior to 2020, and with social distancing rules, has branched out to include pre-made stick-on nails that can be applied by the customer at home.   

The purpose of the application is to extend the online platform and functionality for "Bespoke Nails" to digitally manage customer appointments and orders more easily during the work from home era. The application should allow customer appointments and orders to be made online with a certain level of automation to circumvent all appointments being made via phone call or instagram direct messages which require a high level of time and effort to keep ordered. The application should allow the owner or admin to view and manage the calendar, see all orders in a central location, and send order confirmation and estimated pick-up time. The application should allow the customer to see availability and request an appointment, order pre-made stick-on nails or create a custom order for stick-on nails. 

Further releases of the application may see inclusion of customer authentication to see a history of appointments and designs for a more personalised experience and an online store to handle payments. 

#### Target Audience
Bespoke Nails has an established customer base in the physical location of the service, as well as a strong following on instagram engaging a younger generation through social media. The target audience consists of a younger cohort aged from roughly 14 - 40, with a strong interest in fashion trends, artistic expression and bright, bold design. Bespoke Nails attracts a large percentage of female-identifying persons though gender is not an exclusive characteristic of BN's customers.
